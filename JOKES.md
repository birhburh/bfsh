bfsh - begginer friendly shell

TODO: Rewrite and put to README
With this approach, we can build on top of C++'s existing ecosystem, and bring along existing investments, codebases, and developer populations. There are a few languages that have followed this model for other ecosystems, and Carbon aims to fill an analogous role for C++:

    JavaScript → TypeScript
    Java → Kotlin
    C++ → Carbon
    bash → bfsh

bash has very weird syntax that is frustrating for beginners: add personal story about weird scopes of while read and that every time you need to write case statement you need to google it.

add easter eggs with (peek 2-3)
- amogus
- loss
- hawk tuah
- big chungus
- steamed hams

it will have basic bf symbols as syntax
its loops should be described as antithesis to bash's one
it will have auto complete,
